I believe that our ancestors were so intelligent. I did not know that the school that was created was one of the first free educational systems west of the Rockies. I like the fact that ʻAnakē Kū stated that relations + relevant responsibility=contemporary and traditional rigor that is fun. I believe when children are having fun it affects their social and emotional health as well as their ability to be creators of knowledge. I believe that I can continue to grow in this area by learning all that I can, growing into a sense of confidence, and applying what I know to the Keiki Steps program. I like this-A culturally appropriate e learning environment! "
150,Impact,Pedagogy of Aloha...I wouldn't mind learning more about that.
